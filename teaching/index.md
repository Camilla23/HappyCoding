## Teaching

The tutorials on this site are designed to be used in a classroom environment. I'd recommend using [the tutorials](/tutorials) as lecture material, then using [the examples](/examples) as lab and homework assignments.

I'm planning on adding more resources here, but for now, here are a few thoughts on setting up different types of classes.

## How much time do you have?

- [One Hour](/teaching/guides/hour)
- [One Day](/teaching/guides/day)
- [One Week](/teaching/guides/week)
- [One Semester](/teaching/guides/semester)
- [Multiple Courses](/teaching/guides/curriculum)

## Who are you teaching?

- [Younger Students](/teaching/guides/primary)
- [Artists](/teaching/guides/art)
- [Gamers](/teaching/guides/gamedev)
- [Diversity Outreach](/teaching/guides/outreach)
- [Professionals](/teaching/guides/professionals)

## Want to contribute?

If you have ideas for how this site can be useful for teachers, or if you have resources you'd like to share, please [contact me](/about/contact) or submit issues and pull requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding/wiki/Contributing)!
