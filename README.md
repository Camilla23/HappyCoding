# Happy Coding

[HappyCoding.io](http://HappyCoding.io) is a website devoted to programming tutorials and examples.

[Happy Coding is entirely open source](http://happycoding.io/license.html): everything from the example code to the code that puts the actual site together. You're looking at that source code.

# Contribute

One of the awesome things about open source is that you can contribute. Even if you aren't an expert programmer, there are still things you can do! Read [this page](https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding/wiki/Contributing) for more info.
