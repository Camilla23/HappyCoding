**What is Happy Coding?**

Happy Coding is a collection of tutorials designed to teach you how to program.

**Who are these tutorials designed for?**

They start out with complete novices in mind, so you don't have to know anything about programming.

Maybe you've taken a Java course in high school or college and want to learn how to get to the fun stuff. Maybe you attended a hackathon and are wondering where to go next. Maybe you're an experienced developer just looking for some example code. Or maybe you've never touched any code at all!
