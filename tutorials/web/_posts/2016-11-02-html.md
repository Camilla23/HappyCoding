Now you know that your web browser is a client that sends requests to a server, which is another computer that serves files like a waiter serves food. The client then renders that file and gives you the display you're looking at right now.

HTML stands for hypertext markup language, which is a way for programmers to write files that tell a web browser how to display content.

## Creating an HTML File

You can create an HTML file using any basic text editor. I use [jEdit](http://www.jedit.org/) (in fact I'm using jEdit to type this!), but there are a ton of other options. You could even use Notepad or whatever basic text editor came with your computer. You just don't want to use a word processor like Microsoft Word, just because it'll try to add its own formatting to your text.

To get started, open up your basic text editor and type this basic HTML content into it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>My First Webpage</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Happy Coding</h1>
		<p>Hello world!</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

Then save that as a file named `index.html`. You can save it wherever you want. 
 
## Opening an HTML File

Eventually you'll upload your HTML files to a server so that you can access them over the internet, but for now let's just open it locally.

To do that, right-click the file, then go to `Open with`, and then choose your web browser to open the file.

Alternatively, you can type a `file://` url into your browser to open the file. For example, if I saved my `index.html` file onto my desktop, I would type `file:///C:/Users/Kevin/Desktop/index.html` into my browser to open the file.

Anyway, when you open the file, you should see a page that looks like this:

Go back to your text editor and make a change, save it, and then refresh your browser. You should see your change in the browser. Congratulations, you're an HTML programmer!

## HTML Tags
 
HTML is a **markup language** which means that it contans not just text, but information about how that text should be displayed. HTML uses **tags** to contain that markup. In other words, tags are a way to **mark** content so the browser knows what that content is. 

A tag has a **name** and contains **content**.
