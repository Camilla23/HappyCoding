Now we know how to write code using functions, variables, and if statements. So far our code has worked by executing each line one after the other, so if we wanted to draw three circles, we'd have to write three separate calls to the `ellipse()` function.

This tutorial introduces `for` loops, which allow you to repeat work without repeating code.

## Patterns

Let's start with an example program:

```java
line(25, 0, 25, height);
line(50, 0, 50, height);
line(75, 0, 75, height);
```

This program draws three vertical lines: the first from position `25,0` to `25,height`; the second from position `50,0` to `50,height`; and the third from position `75,0` to `75,height`.

In other words, we're changing the x position of the lines, and then drawing them from the top to the bottom of the window.

If we look closely, we can recognize a pattern in these three lines: the x position starts at `25`, then increase by `25`, and stops at `75`. When we have a pattern like this (start at a number, increase by a number, stop at a number), we can use `for` loops to follow that pattern to repeat code.

## New Syntax

To write a `for` loop, first type the keyword `for`, and then in parentheses `()` you give it three things:

- Declare a variable to keep track of your pattern, and initialize it to the number your pattern starts at: `int lineX = 25;`
- Write a test that evaluates to a `boolean` value of `false` whenever the pattern should stop: `lineX <= 75;`
- Reassign the variable so that it follows the pattern: `lineX = lineX + 25;` (which can be shortened to `lineX += 25`)

Then inside curly brackets `{}`, type the code that uses your variable to follow the pattern. Putting it all together, it looks like this:

```java
for(int lineX = 25; lineX <= 75; lineX += 25){
  line(lineX, 0, lineX, height);
}
```

This is new syntax, so let's go over it piece by piece:

- `int lineX = 25;` creates a **loop variable** with a value of `25`. This only happens **once**, at the very beginning of the loop.
- `lineX <= 75;` decides when to continue looping. This test is evaluated every step (which is called an **iteration**) of the pattern, at the **beginning** of the iteration. Whenever the test evaluates to `false`, the pattern is over and the loop stops iterating.
- `lineX += 25` updates the loop variable. This happens at the **end** of every iteration, after the body of the loop has run.
- `line(lineX, 0, lineX, height);` uses the `lineX` variable to draw a line in the pattern we gave it.

At the end of each iteration (when the code reaches the closing curly bracket `}`), a couple things happen:

- The code executes your reassignment statement to update the loop variable.
- Then the code jumps back to the beginning of the `for` loop!
- The check is evaluated, and if it's `true`, the body of the loop is executed again. If it's `false`, the loop exits and skips over the body.



## Nested For Loops



## Homework

- Write a program that makes every pixel in the window a different random color.
- Write a program that gives you the total of 1+2+3+4+...+100.
