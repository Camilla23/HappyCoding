Now we know how to write code using functions, variables, and if statements. So far our code has worked by executing each line one after the other, so if we wanted to draw three circles, we'd have to write three separate calls to the `ellipse()` function.

This tutorial introduces `for` loops, which allow you to repeat work without repeating code.

## Patterns

Let's start with an example program:

```java
line(25, 0, 25, height);
line(50, 0, 50, height);
line(75, 0, 75, height);
```

This program draws three vertical lines: the first from position `25,0` to `25,height`; the second from position `50,0` to `50,height`; and the third from position `75,0` to `75,height`.

In other words, we're changing the x position of the lines, and then drawing them from the top to the bottom of the window.

If we look closely, we can recognize a pattern in these three lines: the x position starts at `25`, then increase by `25`, and stops at `75`. When we have a pattern like this (start at a number, increase by a number, stop at a number), we can use `for` loops to follow that pattern to repeat code.

## New Syntax

To write a `for` loop, first type the keyword `for`, and then in parentheses `()` you give it three things:

- Declare a variable to keep track of your pattern, and initialize it to the number your pattern starts at: `int lineX = 25;`
- Write a test that evaluates to a `boolean` value of `false` whenever the pattern should stop: `lineX <= 75;`
- Reassign the variable so that it follows the pattern: `lineX = lineX + 25;` (which can be shortened to `lineX += 25`)

Then inside curly brackets `{}`, type the code that uses your variable to follow the pattern. Putting it all together, it looks like this:

```java
for(int lineX = 25; lineX <= 75; lineX += 25){
  line(lineX, 0, lineX, height);
}
```




## Homework

- Write a program that makes every pixel in the window a different random color.
- Write a program that gives you the total of 1+2+3+4+...+100.
