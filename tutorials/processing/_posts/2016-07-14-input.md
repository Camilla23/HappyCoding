Now we know how to use variables, functions, and `if` statements. We know how to modify variables over time to create animations.

We know that Processing gives us predefined variables like `width` and `height`.

We also know that Processing automatically calls the `setup()` function once at the very beginning of the program, and then calls the `draw()` function 60 times per second.

So far our programs have mostly done stuff on their own, without responding to anything that the user does. This tutorial shows you how to get user input to make your programs more interactive.

When I say user input, I mean things like mouse position, mouse clicks, and key typing.

## The `mouseX` and `mouseY` Variables

We've already seen one of the easiest ways to get user input: the `mouseX` and `mouseY` variables. Processing automatically updates these variables to hold the current location of the mouse cursor in the window. You can use these in the `draw()` function to get the position of the mouse.

```java
void draw(){
  background(200);
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 25, 25);
}
```

This program draws a circle wherever the mouse cursor is.

But you don't have to draw things right on top of the cursor. Instead, you can get creative and use the `mouseX` and `mouseY` variables in calculations to do more interesting things.

For example, here's the same program, but with `mouseX` and `mouseY` reversed:

```java
void draw(){
  background(200);
  ellipse(mouseY, mouseX, 25, 25);
}
```

Now the circle mirrors the cursor instead of following it, which ends up feeling pretty weird.

![circle mirroring mouse](/tutorials/processing/input-2.gif)

Here's a slightly more complicated example:

```java
float circleX = 50;
float circleY = 50;

void draw(){
  background(200);
  
  circleX = (circleX*9 + mouseX)/10;
  circleY = (circleY*9 + mouseY)/10;
  
  ellipse(circleX, circleY, 25, 25);
}
```

This program uses a weighted average to move the circle towards the cursor. That might sound complicated, but really all it's doing is giving more weight to the old position, so the circle moves slower instead of staying right on top of the cursor.

The point is, don't be afraid to use the `mouseX` and `mouseY` variables to do interesting things, other than drawing stuff wherever the mouse is.

## The `mousePressed` Variable

The `mouseX` and `mouseY` variables point to `int` values that hold the current value of the mouse.

Similarly, the `mousePressed` variable points to a `boolean` value that is `true` when the mouse is pressed, and `false` when it's not. We can use the `mousePressed` function in an `if` statement to do stuff when the mouse is held down:

```java
void draw() {
  if (mousePressed) {
    background(0, 255, 0);
  } 
  else {
    background(200);
  }
}
```

This program uses an `if` statement to check whether `mousePressed` is `true`. If it is, then it draws a green background. If not, then it draws a gray background.

![gray background that turns green when mouse is pressed](/tutorials/processing/input-4.gif)

In other words, the program displays gray unless the mouse is pressed, then it displays green.

We could combine the `mousePressed` variable with the `mouseX` and `mouseY` variables to create a basic drawing program:

```java
void draw() {
  if (mousePressed) {
    ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 25, 25);
  }
}
```

This program uses an `if` statement to check whether `mousePressed` is `true`. If it is, then it draws an ellipse at `mouseX,mouseY`.

In other words, the program lets you draw with circles whenever the mouse is pressed.

## The `pmouseX` and `pmouseY` Variables

Let's say we want to improve our basic drawing program. Instead of drawing circles, we want to draw a continuous line whenever the user is pressing the mouse. We might try calling the `point()` function instead of the `ellise()` function:

```java
void draw() {
  if (mousePressed) {
    point(mouseX, mouseY);
  }
}
```

But if you run that, you'll notice that the points aren't connected:

![disconnected points](/tutorials/processing/animation-6.gif)

This is because the cursor doesn't pass through every single pixel in its path. If you're moving the mouse very fast, the cursor might jump over a bunch of pixels. Our eyes don't notice this because we fill in the gaps in our brain, but the computer only knows the current position of the cursor, not its path.

To fix this problem, we need to keep track of the **previous** position of the cursor, and then draw a line from that position to the new position. (In other words, we need to connect the dots that we're drawing.) We could do this ourselves by creating variables and then setting them to `mouseX` and `mouseY` at the end of the `draw()` function, but Processing already does this for us.

The `pmouseX` and `pmouseY` variables hold the previous position of the cursor. By itself that might not sound very useful, but they help solve the problem we just saw. Now we can draw our line from the previous position to the new position:

```java
void draw() {
  if (mousePressed) {
    line(pmouseX, pmouseY, mouseX, mouseY);
  }
}
```

By connecting the dots as we draw them, our program looks like it's drawing one continuous line.

## Mouse Input Functions

The `mousePressed` variable is useful when we want to do something continuously, as long as the user has the mouse pressed. But what if we want to detect one-time things like a mouse click?

These one-time things are called **events**, and Processing provides a bunch of functions that it will automatically call whenever an event happens. By writing code inside these functions, you can run code based on these events.

Inside these event functions, you can use the same variables and functions as you can in the `draw()` function. For example, we could add a `mouseClicked()` function to our drawing program to allow the user to draw individual circles whenever they click:

```java
void draw() {
  if (mousePressed) {
    line(pmouseX, pmouseY, mouseX, mouseY);
  }
}

void mouseClicked(){
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 10, 10);
}
```

Processing calls the `draw()` function 60 times per second, and in that we draw a continuous line if the mouse is held down. Processing calls the `mouseClicked()` function once, every time the mouse is clicked, and in that we draw a circle at the current cursor position. In other words, we draw a circle wherever the user clicks, and we draw a line wherever the user drags.

There are a bunch of mouse input functions that allow you to react to more specific events:

- `mousePressed()` is called once when the user presses the mouse button. This is the first half of a click.
- `mouseReleased()` is called once when the user releases the mouse button. This is the second half of a click.
- `mouseClicked()` is called when the mouse is **clicked**. This is a press **and** a release!
- `mouseMoved()` is called whenever the mouse moves.
- `mouseDragged()` is called, you guessed it, whenever the mouse is moved while its button is pressed.
- `mouseWheel()` is called when you scroll with the mouse wheel.
