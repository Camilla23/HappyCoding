Now we know how to use variables, functions, and `for` loops.

So far our variables have held a single value. This tutorial introduces **arrays**, which are variables that hold multiple values.

## Multiple Variables

Let's start with an example program:

```java
float lineX = 0;
float lineSpeed = 1;

void setup() {
  size(300, 100);
}

void draw() {
  background(200);
  line(lineX, 0, lineX, height);

  lineX += lineSpeed;

  if (lineX > width) {
    lineX = 0;
  }
}
```

This program creates two variables: `lineX` and `lineSpeed`. The `setup()` function creates a `300x100` window. In the `draw()` function, a gray background is drawn, and a line is drawn from `lineX,0` to `lineX,height`. Then `lineX` is increased by `lineSpeed`. If `lineX` becomes greater than `width`, then it gets reset back to `0`.

In other words, this program draws a line that moves from the left side to the right side of the window, then resets back to the left side.

## The Bad Way

What if we want to add another line? We might be tempted to just use more variables:

```java
float lineX_0 = 0;
float lineSpeed_0 = 1;

float lineX_1 = 0;
float lineSpeed_1 = 2;

void setup() {
  size(300, 100);
}

void draw() {
  background(200);
  
  line(lineX_0, 0, lineX_0, height);
  lineX_0 += lineSpeed_0;
  if (lineX_0 > width) {
    lineX_0 = 0;
  }
  
  line(lineX_1, 0, lineX_1, height);
  lineX_1 += lineSpeed_1;
  if (lineX_1 > width) {
    lineX_1 = 0;
  }
}

```

This code uses two sets of variables: `lineX_0` and `lineSpeed_0`, and `lineX_1` and `lineX_1` to draw two lines that move across the screen.
