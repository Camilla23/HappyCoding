This tutorial teaches you how to write Processing code. In Processing (and many other languages), one of the basic building blocks we'll use while writing code is **calling functions**.

## What's a function?

A function is a **single instruction** that tells the computer to do **one thing**.

Writing a computer program is a little bit like writing driving instructions for another person to follow. An individual step of those directions might be something like "drive for 5 miles" or "turn left at the light", and you might write each step on its own line. The other person then follows those steps in order, one after the other, in order to get to the destination.

That's very similar to how a computer follows code that you write. Except instead of driving directions, we give the computer a series of **functions** that it **calls**, one after the other, to accomplish our end goal.

## How do I call a function?

To call a function (which is just another way to say "follow the step on this line of the directions"), you need to do four things:

- Write the name of the function.
- Add parenthesis `()` after the function's name.
